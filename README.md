Installation
------------

You can install firebase-server through npm:

`npm install --save-dev firebase-server`

Usage Example
-------------

```js
var FirebaseServer = require('firebase-server');

new FirebaseServer(5000, 'test.firebase.localhost', {
	states: {
		CA: 'California',
		AL: 'Alabama',
		KY: 'Kentucky'
	}
});
```

After running this server, you can create a Firebase client instance that connects to it:

```js
var client = new Firebase('ws://test.firebase.localhost:5000');
client.on('value', function(snap) {
	console.log('Got value: ', snap.val());
});
```

Don't forget to point the host `test.firebase.localhost` to your local IP address (in `/etc/hosts` or similar).

### FirebaseServer methods

FirebaseServer instances have the following API:

* `close()` - Stops the server (closes the server socket) 
* `getData()` - Returns a copy of the current data stored in the server

### Debug logging

You can enable debug logging by calling the `enableLogging()` method:

```js
var FirebaseServer = require('firebase-server');

FirebaseServer.enableLogging(true);
// Create a FirebaseServer instance, etc.
```
